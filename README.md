Meal-Tracker with Angular2 - JS Week 2 Code Review
By:Jon Toler
Description

As a userâ€¦

I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.
I want to view a list of foods I have logged.
I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).


specs:

If a user adds a meal to the list it will populate the list:
ex: input: Waffles, calories 500, Good
output: list Waffles.

User can sort list by calories in food.
ex input user: show meals with 500 calories or less.
output: will display list of meals less than 500 calories.

user can edit a meal item to change it.
ex user input: change waffles to 200 calories.
output: waffles will not be 200 calories.
